# SCAMP-Hardware-Programming

# Introduction
This repository is part of a Final Year EEE Project to add colour acquisition to a monochrome camera known as the [SCAMP Vision Sensor](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/p.dudek/scamp/). This repository contains firmware to be uploaded to the ESP32 modules of each of the three hardware approaches to colourise the SCAMP. When the hardware approaches are running, the code from the [SCAMP Image Acquisition repository](https://github.com/aleifericsson/SCAMP-Image-Acquisition) to function will also be run simultaneously to synchronise the two and systems and record the output.

# Installation
All of the programs here have been written in Python 3.14. To run the program, ensure your system has Python 3.14 and use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the libraries listed on the top of each program.

# Usage/Workflow
1. Import the folder of images with numbered .png files into the same directory from [Image Acquisition](https://github.com/aleifericsson/SCAMP-Image-Acquisition)
2. Run pixel_extracter.py to open an image and extract the hex colour codes of the primary red, green and blue squares of the [ColorChecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColorChecker). This requires pressing on the codes of the squares (13, 14, 15) and defining the corresponding squares' regions on image, then pressing the export button.
3. Run matrix_maker.py and use those values to produce a .txt file of the transformation matrix, which should be made into the same directory
4. Run video_player.py to load the folder of images and view it as a video
5. Press the "Load Matrix" button and load the matrix produced by matrix_maker.py. Tweak saturation and lightness as needed and press "Apply Matrix".
6. Press "Export to MP4" to export the video.
7. Run pixel_extracter.py again on the transformed images of the video to define regions of all the squares of the ColorChecker for extraction.

The method of deriving and using the transformation matrix has been obtained from the following paper:

# Future Improvements
- Automate the entire workflow to be able to be done in one program
